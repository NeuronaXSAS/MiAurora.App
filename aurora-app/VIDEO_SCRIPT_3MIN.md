## THE SCRIPT (Copy for ElevenLabs)

```
Why does the internet feel so unsafe for women?

We scroll feeds designed to make us anxious. We search and get AI-generated garbage. We share our location with apps that sell our data.

I built something different. This is Aurora App.

Our search engine shows you which results are AI-written, which have gender bias, and which sources you can trust. No one else does this. Not Google. Not anyone.

Our safety map lets women rate locations and warn each other. That restaurant? Four point seven stars for safety. That parking lot? Community flagged. Real intelligence from real women.

The panic button works offline. One tap, your location goes to emergency contacts. No wifi needed.

We have circles for private communities. Opportunities from verified women-friendly employers. And an algorithm that doesn't want you addicted.

Now here's how we built this with Kiro.

We used specs to plan every feature. Requirements, design, tasks. All structured before writing code. When we built livestreaming, the spec guided the entire architecture.

Steering files taught Kiro our brand. Our colors, our safety principles, our component patterns. Every generated component follows our guidelines automatically.

Agent hooks automated everything. Save a file, tests run. Update translations, languages sync. Code changes, linting happens instantly.

And MCP extended our reach. We connected Brave Search API, integrated real-time features, added external services. All through Kiro's extensibility.

The result? A complete platform. Search engine. Safety network. Community hub. Career platform. Built in weeks by a small team.

We're live at miaurora.app.

Aurora App. Your safety. Your community. Your growth.

1. **Speak at 150 words/minute** - natural but efficient
2. **No pauses over 1 second** - keep momentum
