**[VISUAL: Black screen → Aurora borealis effect → Logo emerges]**

```
Four billion women.
One platform built just for them.

This is Aurora App.
The future of social networking.

We said: enough.

Aurora App is the first platform with a non-toxic algorithm.
Built by women. Powered by ethical AI. Zero data sales.

Your safety. Your community. Your growth.
All in one beautiful space.
```
