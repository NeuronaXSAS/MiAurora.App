To get started, could you tell me:

2. What are your main monthly expenses?

Once I know these, I can help you create a personalized budget using the 50/30/20 rule:
• 50% for needs (rent, utilities, groceries)
• 30% for wants (entertainment, dining out)
• 20% for savings and debt repayment`;

Tips to build your emergency fund:
• Start with a small, achievable goal ($500-$1,000)
• Set up automatic transfers to a separate savings account
• Put any windfalls (tax refunds, bonuses) directly into savings

The general recommendation is to save 3-6 months of living expenses. To calculate your target, I need to know your monthly expenses.

Here are two popular strategies:

**Avalanche Method** (saves most money):
Pay minimums on all debts, put extra toward highest interest rate first.

**Snowball Method** (builds momentum):
Pay minimums on all debts, put extra toward smallest balance first.

• Calculate how much you could save in interest?`;

To create a personalized debt payoff plan, could you tell me:
1. How much total debt do you have?
2. What types of debt (credit cards, student loans, etc.)?
3. What are the interest rates?

Remember: Having debt doesn't mean you're bad with money. Many women face debt due to systemic issues like the wage gap. Let's work together to create a plan!`;

  // Salary negotiation

**Key tips for women negotiating salary:**

1. **Research thoroughly** - Use Glassdoor, LinkedIn, and industry reports to know your market value

2. **Document your achievements** - Keep a "brag file" of accomplishments, metrics, and positive feedback

3. **Practice your pitch** - Rehearse with a friend or mentor

4. **Use specific numbers** - Ask for a specific amount, not a range

5. **Consider the full package** - Negotiate benefits, remote work, PTO, not just salary

**Powerful phrases to use:**
• "Based on my research and contributions, I'm looking for..."
• "I'm excited about this role. Can we discuss compensation?"
• "What flexibility is there in the salary range?"

Women who negotiate earn on average 7% more than those who don't. You've got this! 🌟

**Getting started with investing:**

1. **Emergency fund first** - Have 3-6 months expenses saved before investing

2. **Employer 401(k)** - If your employer matches, contribute at least enough to get the full match (it's free money!)

3. **Roth IRA** - Great for young women; contributions grow tax-free

4. **Index funds** - Low-cost, diversified way to invest in the market

**Key principles:**
• Start early - Time in the market beats timing the market
• Diversify - Don't put all eggs in one basket
• Stay consistent - Regular contributions matter more than perfect timing
• Think long-term - Ignore short-term market noise

**Quick wins:**
• Review subscriptions - Cancel unused ones
• Negotiate bills - Call providers for better rates
• Meal prep - Reduce food waste and takeout
• Use cashback apps - Rakuten, Ibotta, etc.

**Bigger impact:**
• Housing - Consider roommates or relocating
• Transportation - Public transit, carpooling, or biking
• Insurance - Shop around annually for better rates
• Phone plan - Switch to budget carriers

**The "No-Spend" challenge:**
Try a week of only essential spending to identify habits.
